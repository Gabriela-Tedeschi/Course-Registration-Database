## Registration-Database
Creates a simple database for storing course registration data. Demonstrates how to create and alter tables, add constraints to tables, create views, create and use stored procedures, and implement error handling. This was my final project for Foundations of Databases & SQL Programming (UW Professional & Continuing Education).
